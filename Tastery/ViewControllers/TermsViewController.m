THIS AGREEMENT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE AT HTTP://WWW.TASTERY.PH (THE \"SITE\") AND ALL SERVICES PROVIDED BY TASTERY ON THE SITE.\n\nBy using the Site in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site, you (the \"user\" or \"you\") agree to be bound by this Agreement, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink.\n\n1. Tastery is Owned by Tri-Star Culinary Concepts, Inc.\n\n(T-SCCI)\n\nTastery is a wholly-owned business of Tri-Star Culinary Concepts, Inc. (T-SCCI).  All Tastery graphics, logos, designs, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names are therefore owned by T-SCCI. Tastery's trademarks and trade dress may not be used, including as part of trademarks and/or as part of domain names or email addresses, in connection with any product or service in any manner that is likely to cause confusion.\n\n2. Membership Eligibility\n\nAge: Tastery's services are available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who are 18 years and older who can form legally binding contracts under applicable laws. You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. Tastery may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer access to, or use of, the Site to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Site is revoked in such jurisdictions.\n\nIndividuals under the age of 18 must use Tastery's services in conjunction with, and under the supervision of, a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age. In these cases, the adult is the user and is responsible for any and all activities.\n\nCompliance: You agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct. In addition, you must abide by Tastery's policies as stated in the Agreement and Tastery's Privacy Policy. In addition, some services offered through the Site may be subject to additional terms and conditions promulgated by Tastery from time to time without prior notice; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.\n\nPassword: Keep your password secure at all times. You are fully responsible for all activity, liability and damage resulting from your failure to maintain password confidentiality. You agree to immediately notify Tastery of any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security. You also agree that Tastery will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your password secure. You agree not to divulge your username and password information in combination to any other party other than Tastery without Tastery's express written permission.\n\nAccount Information: You must keep your account information up-to-date and accurate at all times, including a valid email address.\n\nAccount Transfer: You may not transfer or sell your Tastery account and User ID to another party. If you are registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement. Right to Refuse Service: Tastery's services are not available to temporarily or indefinitely suspended Tastery members. Tastery reserves the right to cancel unconfirmed or inactive accounts. Tastery reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, for any reason, at any time.\n\n3. Purchase Policy\n\nBinding Sale: All sales are binding. Tastery is obligated to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the Tastery's listing (such as payment method), or (b) Tastery cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.\n\nOrder Processing: Tastery may choose to cancel your order in certain circumstances. This may occur, for example, when the product or service you wish to purchase is out of stock, we suspect the request is fraudulent, or in other circumstances Tastery deems appropriate in its sole discretion. Tastery also reserves the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your order. Tastery will either not charge you or refund the charges for orders that we do not process or cancel.\n\nRefund Policy: Tastery may grant refunds on certain items on a case-to-case basis.  All refunds are at the sole discretion of Tastery.\n\nPricing: Tastery reserves the right to change its pricing at any time as we see fit and without prior notice.\n\nProduct and Service Availability: Tastery may contain information regarding the availability of merchandise. This information can be used to estimate the likelihood that an item will be shipped immediately after you place your order. However, Tastery cannot guarantee that an item listed as “in stock” will actually be shipped right away, as inventory can change significantly from day-to-day. In rare cases, a product or service offering may be in stock when a customer places the order, and sold out by the time Tastery attempts to process the order. Should this happen, we will notify you by email. Service offerings that are out-of-stock generally are no longer available. If Tastery determines that a product or service you wish to purchase is no longer available, the item will be canceled from your order. We will notify you by email and delete the item from the Site.\n\n4. Prohibited, Questionable and Infringing Items and Activities\n\nYou are solely responsible for your conduct and activities on and regarding to Tastery.\n\nRestricted Activities: Your use of Tastery shall not:\n\n.      Be false, inaccurate or misleading\n\n.      Be fraudulent or involve the sale of illegal, counterfeit or stolen items\n\n.      Infringe upon any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary or intellectual property rights or rights of publicity or privacy\n\n.      Violate this Agreement, any site policy or community guidelines, or any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including, but not limited to, those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or false advertising)\n\n .      Be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening, unlawfully harassing, impersonate or intimidate any person (including Tastery staff or other users), or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with any person, through for example, the use of similar email address, nicknames, or creation of false account(s) or any other method or device\n\n.      Be obscene or contain child pornography\n\n.      Contain or transmit any code or virus of a destructive nature that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information\n\n.      Link directly or indirectly, reference or contain information about goods or services offered external to Tastery.\n\n.      Modify, adapt or hack Tastery or modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with Tastery\n\n5. Breach\n\nWithout limiting any other remedies, Tastery may, without notice, and without refunding any fees, delay or immediately remove Content, warn Tastery's community of a user's actions, issue a warning to a user, temporarily suspend a user, temporarily or indefinitely suspend a user's account privileges, terminate a user's account, prohibit access to the Site, and take technical and legal steps to keep a user off the Site and refuse to provide services to a user if any of the following apply:\n\nTastery suspects (by information, investigation, conviction, settlement, insurance or escrow investigation, or otherwise) a user has breached this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, or other policy documents and community guidelines incorporated herein; Tastery is unable to verify or authenticate any of your personal information; or Tastery believes that a user is acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of Tastery's policies, has engaged in improper or fraudulent activity in connection with Tastery or the actions may cause legal liability or financial loss to Tastery's users or to Tastery.\n\n6. Privacy\n\nExcept as provided in Tastery's Privacy Policy, we will not sell or disclose your personal information (as defined in the Privacy Policy) to third parties without your explicit consent.\n\n7.

All remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n12. Tastery Service\n\nTastery reserves the right to modify or terminate the Tastery service for any reason, without notice, at any time. Tastery reserves the right to alter these Terms of Use or other Site policies at any time.
